# Command Line Control of Second Life Bots

Install `BotControl`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slbotcontrol/BotControl/refs/heads/main/install | bash
```

`BotControl` is a command line management system for `LifeBots` and `Corrade` Second Life
scripted agents (bots). The `botctrl` command can be used to manage either `Lite` or `Full` bots
from `LifeBots` as well as `Corrade` bots configured with the built-in Corrade HTTP service enabled.

The `botctrl` command is installed as `/usr/local/bin/botctrl` and symbolic links are created
for the commands `/usr/local/bin/corrade` and `/usr/local/bin/lifebot`. When invoked as `corrade`
the command uses the Corrade API to control Corrade bots. When invoked as `lifebot` the command
uses the LifeBots API to control LifeBots bots. When invoked as `botctrl` the command can control
either Corrade or LifeBots bots, determining which API to use based on how the bot name was specified
on the command line: `botctrl -c "bot name" ...` indicates use the Corrade API to control a Corrade
bot while `botctrl -n "bot name" ...` indicates control of a LifeBots bot.

## Overview

Truth &amp; Beauty Lab hosts repositories that provide a command line management
system for `Corrade` and `LifeBots` bots as well as an in-world scripted object,
`LifeBots Control Panel`, that acts as a bridge between `LifeBots` management
scripts and `LifeBots` bots.

Both `LifeBots` subscription plans provide a web UI and HUD that can be used for
interactive control of `LifeBots` bots and, for many users, this is sufficient.
There is also a `Corrade` HUD available on the marketplace. The `BotControl` project
is attempting to provide tools that go well beyond the capabilities of these HUDs
and leverage the powerful features provided by the `Corrade` and `LifeBots` API.

For developers who wish to script `LifeBots` management, command, and control, the
[LifeBots Control Panel](https://github.com/missyrestless/LifeBotsControlPanel#readme)
provides and easy to use in-world interface to the `LifeBots API`, enabling the
automation of many of the rich `LifeBots` feature set.

For those power users who wish to automate their `Corrade` and `LifeBots` bots using
the command line and tools such as `cron` and `jq`, the `botctrl` command and associated
utilities found here may provide additional power and flexibility.

The `BotControl` command line management system is open source and free to download,
deploy, modify, and distribute.

`Corrade` and `LifeBots` bots managed by the `botctrl` command line and scheduled using
the Unix `cron` facility can be viewed and interacted with in Second Life at the
[Truth & Beauty Lab](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Brightbrook%20Isle/56/135/23)
or [Club Truth & Beauty](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Scylla/226/32/78).

### Corrade Overview

The primary advantage of `Corrade` over most other Second Life bots is the
ability to self-host `Corrade` meaning I can run it on my own computers, manage
and update it myself, and my bots are not dependant on some cloud service
that may disappear at any time. This is a significant advantage.

`Corrade` is a multi-purpose, multi-platform scripted agent (bot) that runs under
Windows or Unix natively, as a service or daemon whilst staying connected to a
Linden-based grid (either Second Life or OpenSim) and controlled entirely by scripts.

The scripts in this repository are original scripting by Truth &amp; Beauty Lab.

### LifeBots Overview

[LifeBots](https://lifebots.cloud) bills itself as:

> The most advanced bot platform for Second Life. From AI characters to
> complete group automation, we've got everything your community needs.

I cannot disagree - `LifeBots` is the most advanced bot platform for Second Life. However,
`Corrade` can be self-hosted and offers a very rich API making it a reasonable free
alternative to the cloud based subscription service `LifeBots` offers.

`LifeBots` offers 2 subscription plans, `Lite` and `Full`. The plans provide these features:

| `LifeBots` Lite (`L$165/wk`) | `LifeBots` Full (`L$450/wk`) |
|:---------------------------- |:---------------------------- |
| Basic bot functionality      | All Lite Bot features        |
| Greeter Bot addon            | Group Notice scheduling      |
| HUD Support                  | Group IM scheduling          |
| Dialog Menu Interactions     | Group Web Chat               |
| RLV capabilities             | Group Discord Sync           |
| Compatible addons support    | Complete addon support       |
| API access                   | Advanced AI integration      |
| Email support                | Priority support             |

|                              | Avatar Specific Memory       |
|                              | Advanced analytics           |

## BotControl Command Line

The `BotControl Command Line` is a suite of tools that enable control and management of
`Corrade` and `LifeBots` bots via the Unix/Linux command line. These tools are executed in
a terminal using the Bash shell and utilities such as `curl`, `sed`, `awk`, `jq`, and others.

The primary command line tool is the `botctrl` Bash script which acts as a front-end
for `Corrade` and `LifeBots` API requests.

### Requirements

The `botctrl` command line management system requires:

- Unix, Linux, Macos, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Bash
- Cron
- curl
- git
- [jq](https://jqlang.org)

These requirements, with the exception of `jq`, are typically included in the base
operating system on all supported platforms. If your platform does not have `jq`
installed then you can still use `botctrl`, a few of the helper utilities will not
function properly but the bulk of the system will function without `jq`.

### Install botctrl

To install `botctrl`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slbotcontrol/BotControl.git
cd BotControl
./install
```

Or, you can use the `curl` command to install `botctrl` with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slbotcontrol/BotControl/refs/heads/main/install | bash
```

Alternatively, download the `install` release artifact and execute it.
The `install` script will clone the repository and install the system:

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/slbotcontrol/BotControl/releases/latest/download/install
chmod 755 install
./install
```

### Configure Corrade for use with the botctrl command

Version 2 and later of the `botctrl` command supports command and control of both
`LifeBots` and `Corrade` bots.

In order to use the `botctrl` command to manage your `Corrade` bot(s):

- The HTTP server must be enabled in the `Corrade` configuration
- `ScriptLanguage` must be set to `JSON` in the `Corrade` configuration

Example snippet to enable the HTTP server in `CorradeConfiguration.xml`:

```xml
<Servers>
    <HTTPServer>
        <Enable>1</Enable>
        <Prefixes>
            <Prefix>http://+:8082/</Prefix>
        </Prefixes>
    </HTTPServer>
    ...
</Servers>
```

Set the port number in the `Prefix` configuration to an open unused port.
If you have more than one `Corrade` bot then use a different port for each.

To set the `ScriptLanguage` to JSON in `CorradeConfiguration.xml`:

```xml
  <ScriptLanguage>JSON</ScriptLanguage>
```

### Configure botctrl

The `botctrl` command is installed in `/usr/local/bin` along with some
utility scripts for use with `cron` or other management systems. These
utility scripts will need to be modified to suit your specific needs,
configuration and bot names. You can modify the scripts in
`bin/` and re-run `./install`.

Add `/usr/local/bin` to your execution `PATH` if it is not already included.

Configure `botctrl` by adding and editing the file `${HOME}/.botctrl`.

If you wish to control `LifeBots` bots then you must configure your `LifeBots`
developer API key and bot secrets for the `LifeBots` bots you wish to control.

If you wish to control `Corrade` bots then you must configure your `Corrade`
group, password, and server URL.

The following example entries in `$HOME/.botctrl` will allow you to control a
`LifeBots` bot named "Your Botname" and a `Corrade` bot named "Cory Bot":

```bash
# Minimum contents of $HOME/.botctrl
#
# LifeBots Developer API Key
export LB_API_KEY='<your-lifebots-api-key>'
# LifeBots bot secret
export LB_SECRET_Your_Botname='<your-bot-secret>'
# Corrade Group, Password, and Server URL
export CORRADE_GROUP="<your-corrade-bot-group-name>"
export CORRADE_PASSW="<your-corrade-bot-group-password>"
export CORRADE_URL="https://your.corrade.server"
# The Corrade bot's API URL
# This assumes a reverse proxy setup has been configured and this URL
# path is passed by the web server to the appropriate Corrade HTTP port
export API_URL_Cory_Bot="${CORRADE_URL}/cory/"
```

Add an entry of the form `export LB_SECRET_Firstname_Lastname='<bot-secret>'`
to `$HOME/.botctrl` for each of your `LifeBots` bots.

Add an entry of the form `export API_URL_Firstname_Lastname="${CORRADE_URL}/path/"`
to `$HOME/.botctrl` for each of your `Corrade` bots.

See `BotControl/example_dot_botctrl` for a template to use for `$HOME/.botctrl`.

See `BotControl/crontab.in` for example crontab entries to schedule bot activities.

See the section [Scheduling Bot Actions](#scheduling-bot-actions) below for more
details on scheduling bot actions.

#### BotControl Examples

<details><summary>Click here to view an

**example demonstrating outfit change and capturing return value**

</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# To change the outfit of a configured Corrade bot use the corrade command
# with the wear_outfit action. In this example we specify the bot name as Easy, an
# alias configured in ~/.botctrl with BOT_NAME_Easy="Easy Islay"
#
# Note, we can use the -n Name command line arguments to specify the bot name because
# we are using the corrade command. The same command could be run using the botctrl
# command but it would be "botctrl -a wear_outfit -c Easy ...", using the -c Name instead.
#
# In this example we use the jq JSON parser, if it is available, to filter the returned
# JSON and capture the returned success value in a variable. In this way we can decide
# whether to proceed with the next bot action based on the success or failure of the command.
#
# NOTE: all Corrade API requests return this 'success' JSON field allowing any Corrade
# command to do something similar - check the result and act accordingly.

# Replace 'Easy' with your Corrade bot name or an alias for the name you have configured
BOT_NAME="Easy"
# Replace this outfit name with one from your Corrade bot retrieved with the
# get_corrade_outfits.sh example
OUTFIT_NAME='** Legacy Basic Pretty in Pink **'

debug=
[ "$1" == "-v" ] && debug=1

if [ "${debug}" ]; then
  corrade -a wear_outfit -n "${BOT_NAME}" -O "${OUTFIT_NAME}" -v
else
  have_jq=$(type -p jq)
  if [ "${have_jq}" ]; then
    retval=$(corrade -a wear_outfit -n "${BOT_NAME}" -O "${OUTFIT_NAME}" | jq -r '.success')
    if [ "${retval}" == "True" ]; then
      echo "Outfit change succeeded! We can go out to the club now."
    else
      echo "Outfit change failed :( Run me again with the -v argument to see what's wrong."
    fi
  else
    corrade -a wear_outfit -n "${BOT_NAME}" -O "${OUTFIT_NAME}"
  fi
fi
```

</details>

**[NOTE:]** the examples below all assume you have configured `$HOME/.botctrl`
with your `LifeBots` API key and the bot secret:

```bash
# LifeBots Developer API Key
export LB_API_KEY='<redacted>'
# John Doebot LifeBots secret
export LB_SECRET_John_Doebot='<redacted>'

	-C channel specifies the channel for a message [default: 0]
	-c corrade specifies a Corrade bot name to act upon
	-D data specifies a Corrade Manager class member
	-F filter specifies a filter to match when listing attachments
	-M message specifies the message body for a group notice/im
	-N name specifies the name of the recipient of an IM or landmark/notecard
	-O name specifies an attachment object name or outfit name
	-S subject specifies the subject for a group notice
	-s secret specifies a Bot secret, use environment instead
	-T text specifies the notecard text or dialog button text for reply to menus
	-u uuid specifies a UUID for use with actions that require one (e.g. sit)
	-z num specifies a hover height adjustment size [default: -0.05]
		can also be used to specify a payment amount
	-d indicates dryrun mode - tell me what you would do without doing anything
	-e displays a list of supported commands and examples then exits
	-i retrieves Bot details
	-h displays this usage message and exits

Environment:
  Entries in ~/.botctrl can be LB_API_KEY, LB_SECRET, or entries
  of the form LB_SECRET_BOT_NAME in order to support multiple bots
  Entries can specify a Slurl alias. For example:
    export SLURL_club='http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Scylla/226/32/78'
  A Slurl alias can be used with the -l command line argument, e.g. -l club
  Entries can also specify a UUID alias. For example:
    export UUID_Mover='xxxxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbb'
  A UUID alias can be used with the -u command line argument, e.g. -u Mover

Examples:
  botctrl  # Displays the status of the default Bot
  botctrl -a login -l Home # Default Bot login to Home location
  botctrl -a touch_prim -n 'Jane Doe' -u Mover # Jane Doe bot touch object with aliased UUID
  botctrl -a stand -n Jane -c John # Jane bot sends the stand command to Corrade bot John
  botctrl -a teleport -l club  # Uses a 'club' location alias defined in .botctrl

### Scheduling Bot Actions

**[Note:]** A more modern approach to scheduled LifeBots activities is available
as a `LifeBots Add-On` with the `Routine Planner Add-On` at
[https://lifebots.cloud/store/addon/routine-planner](https://lifebots.cloud/store/addon/routine-planner).
With `Routine Planner` you can build fully automated, interactive bot behaviors using
routines that run on schedules, react to chat/IM triggers, execute actions step-by-step,
and even branch routines based on user responses.

The Truth & Beauty Lab utilizes the `Cron` subsystem on Linux and Macos to
schedule bot actions. Truth & Beauty Lab bots are logged in, teleported
to various locations, seated on various objects, and engaged in a variety of
activities using `crontab` entries that execute `Corrade` and `LifeBots` API
requests at scheduled times. Here is an example `crontab` entry with some brief
descriptions in comments of what activities are scheduled:

```

Here is the code for one of the control scripts, the `checkstatus` script that
reports the online/offline status of configured bots:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# checkstatus - get status of a Corrade and LifeBots bots
#
# Usage: checkstatus [-n name]

# Default bot

}

  echo "ERROR: cannot locate botctrl in PATH"
  exit 1
}

  printf "\nWhere:"
  printf "\n\t-A indicates check status of all bots [All Bots: ${ALL_BOTS}]"

}

  exit 1
}

    else
      botctrl -a status -n ${BOT}
    fi
  fi
fi
```

This script uses a couple of aliases defined in `$HOME/.botctrl`, the `club`
location alias and the `Easy` bot name alias:

```bash
export BOT_NAME_Easy="Easy Islay"
export SLURL_club="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Scylla/226/32/78"
```

Aliases provide some convenience. For example, the command

```bash
botctrl -a teleport -n Easy -l club
```

is just an easier way of issuing the command

```bash
botctrl -a teleport -n "Easy Islay" -l "http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Scylla/226/32/78"
```

### Using the JSON return as Input

The `botctrl` command returns a JSON object containing the results of the API request. This
object can be parsed with `jq` and the return values used as input to another `botctrl` command.

For example, if you want to send all of the L$ balance of your bot to yourself:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# send_bot_balance - get the bot's balance and send it to myself
#
# Usage: send_bot_balance [-A] [-n bot_name] [-N recipient_name] [-u uuid]

# Set this to your Second Life avatar name
DEF_SL_NAME="Missy Restless"
# Set this to your bot's name
DEF_BOT_NAME="Easy"
# Set this to all your bots names or their aliases, for use with -A
ALL_LB_BOTS="Anya"
ALL_CO_BOTS="Angel Easy"
ALL_BOTS="${ALL_LB_BOTS} ${ALL_CO_BOTS}"

A script like this could be used to automate transfer of L$ from your bots to your
primary avatar. For example, automated transfer of a bot's L$ balance on the 1st of
every month could be setup to run as a `cron` job with the following `crontab` entry:

```
# Send the Easy Islay bot's L$ balance to myself on the 1st of every month
0 0 1 * * /bin/bash -lc /usr/local/BotControl/send_easy_balance >> /usr/local/BotControl/log/easy.log 2>&1
```

## LifeBots Control Panel

**[Note:]** `LifeBots Control Panel` has moved to its own repository at
[https://github.com/missyrestless/LifeBotsControlPanel](https://github.com/missyrestless/LifeBotsControlPanel)

`LifeBots Control Panel` is an LSL script library to control `LifeBots` bots from an LSL script.

The `LifeBots Control Panel` is a scripted in-world object that acts as a bridge between your
LifeBots management scripts and your LifeBots bots. The control panel communicates with your bots
using the `LifeBots API` and an HTTP server listening to events.
